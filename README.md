# Credit Risk Classificaton 

## Overview of the Analysis

* Purpose of the analysis - To build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers
* Financial information the data was on - Columns of borrower financial and loan information. I used this data to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers by analyzing historical data.
* Variables - Assigned loan_status to y as the target variable and all other columns to X
* Stages - Checked the data, assigned variables, split the data, assigned random state, generated confusion matrix, printed the report
* Method - Logistic Regression Model

## Results

Accuracy - 0.99 for both training and testing reports 
Precision - High risk loans comapred to healthy loans had a prcision of 0.85
Recall - 1.00 and 0.90 for training report  0.99 and 0.91 for testing report

## Summary
Model 0 for healthy loans seems to have the most support and the best results. Therefore I would recommend model as it was 0 was pretty good and model 1 was decent at predicting high risk loans.
Strong precision and recall on the test dataset is a good indication of how well the model is likely to perform in real life.
